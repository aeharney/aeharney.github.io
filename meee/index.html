     <h2>Junior in Graphic Design</h2>
     <p>My goals are to be able to design a funtional website that looks nice, while not losing my mind or going crazy.</p>
     <p>I'm interested in rugby, food and being a part of the queer community. All of these things use the internet to allow me to connect with other people who have the same interests, people who I would probably never be able to meet in real life (due to distance).</p>
     <p>I have no idea of what I want to build for my final project yet. I'd like to understand these programs at least a little better. But probably something rugby, to be totally honest.</p>
